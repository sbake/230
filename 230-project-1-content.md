### High Concept:
A Game about friends, life, and finding meaning. Maybe.
Gather friends and get past obstacles, just to find out why.

### Genre and Description:

Dadaic will be a puzzle game with exploration and platformer elements. 
In a world with no color, find other friends to make your world a little more exciting! 
Then mercilessly use these newfound friends to conquer obstacles and reach the _End_, where Legend says you'll find the
answer to why your world lost it's color in the first place.

### Themes and Story:
_n+1 Minds are better than n._
A formerly-colorful grey cube in a formerly-colorful grey world solves puzzles to find out why everything is so
desaturated. 

### Esthetics:
#### Art:
Simple, abstract, and with varying levels of color. Player characters and the "friends" they'll make will all be cubes
of the same size, while all levels will be similarly square-like. Not quite pixels, but built like a game with a very 
low pixel count.
#### Music:
Sounds and music will mostly consist of background music, which, like color, will get more elaborate the more followers
a player has accumulated. This will cap out pretty quickly, but will vary between silence, a single toned, slow ambient chime, 
a more complex 8-bit tune. The original chime will be as few notes as possible without being annoying- no monotone beeping or
whines.

### Mechanics:
The player will used Arrow keys and the space bar to move and jump, and key commands to gather, dismiss, and control 
other friend boxes. Music, color, and jump height will vary depending on how many boxes are in play.

These simple mechanics will be used to solve more complex puzzles: With a few boxes, a player might be able to build 
a staircase to a previously unreachable location. Likewise, a player could take control of all the boxes and catapult
the player's box higher. 
As color changes, barriers may change- a barrier that starts as dark grey and blocks the player may turn another hue 
match the background as the player makes new allies, allowing them to pass through. On the other hand, the same might
happen to bridges, forcing them to find another way or leave someone behind.

engines, and color design.
